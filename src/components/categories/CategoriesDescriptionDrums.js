      <h2>Unleash your inner drummer</h2>
      <p>
        Whether it’s a single tambourine or an elaborate 8-piece drum kit,
        percussion keeps the pulse of the music going. Check out all our best
        drums and percussion instruments here.

      <h2>Drive the band with a full drum kit</h2>
      <p>
        Most rock, country, or jazz bands need a drum set, also referred to as a
        kit. At the minimum, you’ll want a 4- or 5-piece set that includes a
        bass drum, 2 or 3 toms, and a snare, along with a hi-hat, ride, and
        crash cymbal. Ddrum makes some great entry-level kits, or for higher-end
        instruments check out Tama.

        Drum sets can be expanded almost endlessly with extra toms, double kick
        pedals, cowbells, a gong, and cymbals that range from tiny to massive.
        And no matter what drum set you get, don’t forget the drumsticks!

      <h2>Keep it quiet with an electronic kit</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing beats a live acoustic drum set’s sound, but for quiet at-home
        practice or an easy sound-check at gigs, many players prefer electronic
        drums. Models by Alesis or Roland usually emulate 5-piece drum sets with
        adjustable sound levels, different acoustic features, and audio outputs
        that go directly into an amp, PA, or headphones.
      </p>
      <h2>Mellow jams with minimalist percussion</h2>
      <p>
        You won’t always need or even want a full drum set. Smaller jam sessions
        and coffee shop gigs get overpowered by bigger drum kits, but they can
        benefit from light hand percussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Djembe drums with skin heads give a deep African-style sound. Cajon box
        drums can produce both shrill and deep percussive jabs, and are popular
        with small acoustic groups. Even in a bigger band setting, auxiliary
        percussion like tambourines, bongos, maracas, and more will fill up and
        tighten your mix.
