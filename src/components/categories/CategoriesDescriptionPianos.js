      <h2>MIDI Controllers</h2>
      <p>
        MIDI controllers are simple yet powerful audio interface devices that
        let you control complex hardware and software. MIDI stands for “musical
        instrument digital interface,” and the MIDI system sends digital signals
        from a controller to recording software. You’re then able to blend
        virtually any instrument with perfect timing, create and utilize varying
        effects, and loop your own beats. Browse Midi Controllers from M-Audio,
        Arturia, Novation, & ICON, and take your music to the next level.

      <h2>Keyboards</h2>
      <p>
        A keyboard looks like a digital piano, but doesn’t necessarily have 88
        keys. You can find all kinds of models at Grease, from entry level and
        toys for kids, to highly professional gear used by music producers and
        on-stage musicians. The most common keyboards have 61 or 76 keys; in
        short, a keyboard is smaller, lighter, and more portable than a digital
        piano. Set up your sound station anywhere, and play the same keys the
        pros play, from brands like Roland, Yamaha, Korg, Casio and more.
