              Some of our used equipment is still under warranty through the
              manufacturer. When you purchase the equipment, you will be
              notified of any existing warranty and the amount of time remaining
              on the coverage. In addition, Grease provides its own warranty for
              most of our used equipment. The{" "}
              <Link to="/help/warranties">Grease Used Warranty</Link> provides
              full coverage for manufacturing defects.
