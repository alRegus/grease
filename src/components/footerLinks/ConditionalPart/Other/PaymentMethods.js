              Grease accepts VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Visa Checkout
              and Discover. Your credit card is charged only at the time of the
              actual shipment of item(s). However, there might be a temporary
              hold on the funds until the time of actual shipment. If paying by
              Debit or Check Card, the funds are authorized as soon as the order
              is placed, which may affect the availability of funds in the
              account.

              a shipping address that is different than the billing address,
