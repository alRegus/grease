Regarding electric guitar, I'm a beginner, but I had an experienced friend check it out, and he deemed it a fine instrument at the price point (which I got it through Slickdeals.net for $50 off). I'd recommend it to any beginner or maybe even intermediate guitarist.",

The dual and harmony functions make the whole thing even smoother by being able to assign an extra sound to the played part. The dual function adds a second sound, making the whole sound fuller because it gives the impression that two instruments are playing simultaneously. The harmony function adds harmony to the keys played to create a kind of duet-feel. When a piano sound is selected, pressing the sustain pedal will simulate the string resonance and resonance of the soundboard as it sounds on an acoustic piano. The other strings will vibrate and make the sound even more realistic. The twinova function is useful in a piano lessons.
